Create a file called reflections.txt in the top level directory of your project. There, you should answer the following questions:

How long did you spend working on this project?

2 ~ 3 hours

What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?

Figuring out that the transactions class required product and customer objects. No doi, in hindsight.

What two additional features did you build? Why?

1! Print customer details (see example on app.rb:73); thought it was beneficial to have a snapshot view of all products purchased (product titles) in a human readable format.

2! Lookup transactions by customer name (see exmaple on app.rb:87); store keepers don't speak interms of hashed objects, they use names to query information so this feature was added as well.

Where do you still have room to grow?

1) Speed - specifically noting the obvious requirement that transaction needed objects, not strings, or other simple data types.

2) Error handling.
